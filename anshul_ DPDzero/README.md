Setting up the Project:-
Follow these steps to set up and start the server:

1-Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) if you haven't already.

2-Initialize the project by running the following command in the terminal:

npm init

Install the required dependencies by executing the following command:

npm install

Starting the Server
To start the server, run the following command:

npm start

This command will use nodemon to watch for changes in the app.js file and automatically restart the server whenever changes are detected.

If you haven't installed nodemon globally, you can do so with the following command:

npm install  nodemon

Once nodemon is installed, you can start the server using npm start as mentioned above.
